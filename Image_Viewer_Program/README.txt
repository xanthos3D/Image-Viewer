hello professor. my project is a group of files with a specific directory needed to work in java. everything needs to be in the right files so instead of posting them all here without the files here is the link to my google drive

if you want to run my code you will need intelij IDEA as well as the javafx standard librarys. if you need help setting those up or if you are having trouble getting them to work I wouldnt mind showing you a live presentation of how my program works if that is more convienient for you.
